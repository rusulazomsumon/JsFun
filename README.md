Description:
This repository is a collection of JavaScript handy tools that I've developed for various tasks. These tools aim to simplify common JavaScript operations and provide reusable functions for different use cases.

Tags:

[FEATURE] - Adding a new tool or feature
[BUGFIX] - Fixing a bug in an existing tool
[REFACTOR] - Refactoring code for better performance or readability
[DOCS] - Updating documentation files
[TESTS] - Adding or modifying test cases
[CHORE] - General maintenance tasks, such as updating dependencies or file structure

Git Writing Rules:

- Use present tense in the subject line
- Start the subject line with a capital letter
- Keep the subject line concise and descriptive
- Use imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")

Example Commit Messages:

[FEATURE] Add utility function for string manipulation

This commit adds a new utility function, `capitalize`, which capitalizes the first letter of a string. The function accepts a string as input and returns the modified string. Tests for this function have been added in the `tests/utils.test.js` file.

[BUGFIX] Fix issue with array sorting

There was a bug in the sorting algorithm used for arrays. This commit fixes the issue by implementing a more efficient sorting algorithm. Tests have been updated to reflect the changes.

[REFACTOR] Improve performance of file parsing function

The existing file parsing function was not efficient for large files. This commit refactors the code to improve performance by using a streaming approach for file reading. The function now handles large files more efficiently.

[DOCS] Update README with usage instructions

The README file has been updated to provide detailed usage instructions for each tool in the repository. This will help users understand how to use the tools effectively.

[TESTS] Add additional tests for array manipulation functions

This commit adds more test cases to ensure the correctness and robustness of the array manipulation functions. The tests cover various edge cases and scenarios to validate the behavior of the functions.

[CHORE] Update dependencies to latest versions

The project dependencies have been updated to their latest versions to ensure compatibility and leverage the latest features and bug fixes. The package.json file has been updated accordingly.
